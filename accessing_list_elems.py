# ACCESSING LIST ELEMS

# accessing list elements is pretty simple at first but there are lots of ways you can do it
# to access one element from a list, write the name of the list and the index of the element in square brackets
# basic access of list elements looks like:
my_list = [1, 53, 23]
my_list[2] # equals 23

# the reason my_list[2] equals 23 and not 53 is because list indices start from 0 instead of 1
# that means that the first element is my_list[0], the second element is my_list[1] and so on

# EXERCISES:
my_list = [1, 56, 54412, 653, 10e5]
# put each element of the list into a variable and make sure the code runs

# MORE TO BE ADDED LATER BUT THESE ARE THE IMPORTANT BITS
