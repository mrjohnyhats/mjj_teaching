# DATA OPERATORS

# data operators are symbols (like + and *) that you can use to change you data

# STRINGS:

# strings have these data operators:

# + to add 2 strings together ex: "sup" + "reme" is equal to "supreme"
# * to multiply a string ex: "skra"*3 is equal to "skraskraskra"

# strings have some other operators but they're not as important as these

# EXERCISES:
# make 5 string variables and 5 other variables equal to some of those variables combined (use +) and make sure the code runs

# make 5 string variables that use multiplication NO MORE THAN 50 TIMES and make sure the code runs

# NUMBERS

# numbers have these data operators

# + to add 2 numbers together ex: 1 + 1 is  2
# - to subtract 2 numbers ex: 1 - 1 is  0
# / to divide 2 numbers ex: 10/5 is 2
# // to divide 2 numbers but round the answer to an integer ex: 5//3 is 1
# * to multiply to numbers ex: 69*420 is 28980
# ^ to bring a number to a power ex: 2^6 is is 64

# EXERCISES
# make 5 number variables that use number data operators and make sure the code runs
